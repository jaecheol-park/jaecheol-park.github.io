Welcome to my website! 

I am Jaecheol Park, a Ph.D. candidate in [Management Information Systems](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/programs/phd/phd-business-administration/specializations/management-information-systems) at Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia. I'm under the supervision of Prof. [Gene Moo Lee](https://blogs.ubc.ca/genemoolee/) at [UBC Data Analytics & AI Research Group](https://blogs.ubc.ca/analyticsailab/). 

My research interests lie in **the economics of information systems** focusing on **management and strategies of emerging technologies** such as **AI**, **mobile IT**, and **platforms**. Methodologically, I employ econometrics with machine learning techniques to analyze large panel data to uncover business insights, generating contributions to academia and real-world decision makers in information systems policy and management.

Prior to joining UBC, I received my Master of Science (MS) in [Information Systems](https://sites.google.com/site/isatyonsei/%EB%A9%94%EC%9D%B8%ED%99%94%EB%A9%B4), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), and Bachelor of Art (BA) in Applied Statistics from Yonsei University.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.** Please kindly find my [CV](https://jaecheol-park.github.io/files/Jaecheol_Park_CV_website.pdf) here.
