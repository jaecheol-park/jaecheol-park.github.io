Welcome to my website! 

I am Jaecheol Park, an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Information Technology and Operations Management](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/business/research/academic-divisions/itom) at Nanyang Business School (NBS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. Prior to joining NBS, I received my Ph.D. in [Management Information Systems](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/programs/phd/phd-business-administration/specializations/management-information-systems) at Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia under the supervision of Prof. [Gene Moo Lee](https://blogs.ubc.ca/genemoolee/) at [UBC Data Analytics & AI Research Group](https://blogs.ubc.ca/analyticsailab/). Before joining UBC, I received my Master of Science (MS) in [Information Systems](https://sites.google.com/site/isatyonsei/%EB%A9%94%EC%9D%B8%ED%99%94%EB%A9%B4), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), and Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Applied Statistics from Yonsei University.

My research interests lie in **the economics of information systems**, with a particular focus on **the management and strategic implications of emerging technologies** such as **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **mobile IT**, and **digital platforms**. Methodologically, I employ econometrics with machine learning techniques to analyze large panel datasets, aiming to generate business insights that contribute to both academic research and practical decision-making in information systems policy and management.
